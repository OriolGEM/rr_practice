# How to fold a paper airplane

1. **Crease a piece of letter-sized paper in half lengthwise**. Get a piece of printer paper thatâ€™s a rectangle and lay it on a flat surface. Fold the paper in half lengthwise so the paper looks like a long rectangle. Crease the fold with your fingernail before unfolding the paper again.
2.  **Bring the top corners toward the center crease**. Once the paper is flat again, grab one of the top corners and fold it toward the crease you just made to form a triangle. Press along the fold with your fingernail so the fold stays in place. Repeat the fold along the other top corner so the top of your paper forms a point.
3.  **Fold the angled top edges toward the crease again**. Grab the new top corner on one side of your paper and fold toward the crease to form a long triangle. Run your fingernail across the fold to secure it in place. Fold the other top corner in the same way so your piece of paper looks like a large triangle.
4.  **Fold the paper along the centerline. Use the first crease you made as a guide for making your next fold**. Fold the airplane in half along the crease so the triangles you made are on the inside. Slide your fingernail across the crease so the fold stays in place.
5.  **Crease the angled side toward the center fold to create the wings**. Bring the angled side of the paper to the fold you just made down the middle. Crease the paper with your knuckle or fingernail. Flip the paper airplane over to create the wing on the other side. Once both sides are creased, unfold them slightly so the plane is flat on top.
